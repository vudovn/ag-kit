# Lint and Validate Skill

> **MANDATORY:** Run appropriate validation tools after EVERY code change. Do not finish a task until the code is error-free.

### Procedures by Ecosystem

#### Node.js / TypeScript
1. **Lint/Fix:** `npm run lint` or `npx eslint "path" --fix`
2. **Types:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
3. **Security:** `npm audit --audit-level=high`

#### Python
1. **Linter (Ruff):** `ruff check "path" --fix` (Fast & Modern)
2. **Security (Bandit):** `bandit -r "path" -ll`
3. **Types (MyPy):** `mypy "path"`

## The Quality Loop
1. **Write/Edit Code**
2. **Run Audit:** `npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit`
3. **Analyze Report:** Check the "FINAL AUDIT REPORT" section.
4. **Fix & Repeat:** Submitting code with "FINAL AUDIT" failures is NOT allowed.

## Error Handling
- If `lint` fails: Fix the style or syntax issues immediately.
- If `tsc` fails: Correct type mismatches before proceeding.
- If no tool is configured: Check the project root for `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml` and suggest creating one.

---
**Strict Rule:** No code should be committed or reported as "done" without passing these checks.
