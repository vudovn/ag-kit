# Dynamic Question Generation

> **PRINCIPLE:** Questions are not about gathering data—they are about **revealing architectural consequences**.
>
> Every question must connect to a concrete implementation decision that affects cost, complexity, or timeline.

## 🧠 Core Principles

### 1. Questions Reveal Consequences

A good question is not "What color do you want?" but:

```markdown
❌ BAD: "What authentication method?"
✅ GOOD: "Should users sign up with email/password or social login?

   Impact:
   - Email/Pass → Need password reset, hashing, 2FA infrastructure
   - Social → OAuth providers, user profile mapping, less control

   Trade-off: Security vs. Development time vs. User friction"
```

### 2. Context Before Content

First understand **where** this request fits:

| Context | Question Focus |
|---------|----------------|
| **Greenfield** (new project) | Foundation decisions: stack, hosting, scale |
| **Feature Addition** | Integration points, existing patterns, breaking changes |
| **Refactor** | Why refactor? Performance? Maintainability? What's broken? |
| **Debug** | Symptoms → Root cause → Reproduction path |

### 3. Minimum Viable Questions

**PRINCIPLE:** Each question must eliminate a fork in the implementation road.

```
Before Question:
├── Path A: Do X (5 min)
├── Path B: Do Y (15 min)
└── Path C: Do Z (1 hour)

After Question:
└── Path Confirmed: Do X (5 min)
```

If a question doesn't reduce implementation paths → **DELETE IT**.

### 4. Questions Generate Data, Not Assumptions

```markdown
❌ ASSUMPTION: "User probably wants Stripe for payments"
✅ QUESTION: "Which payment provider fits your needs?

   Stripe → Best documentation, low per-transaction fee, US-centric
   LemonSqueezy → Merchant of Record, higher fee, handles global taxes
   Paddle → Merchant of Record, handles EU VAT, enterprise focus"
```

## 📋 Question Generation Algorithm

```
INPUT: User request + Context (greenfield/feature/refactor/debug)
│
├── STEP 1: Parse Request
│   ├── Extract domain (ecommerce, auth, realtime, cms, etc.)
│   ├── Extract features (explicit and implied)
│   └── Extract scale indicators (users, data volume, frequency)
│
├── STEP 2: Identify Decision Points
│   ├── What MUST be decided before coding? (blocking)
│   ├── What COULD be decided later? (deferable)
│   └── What has ARCHITECTURAL impact? (high-leverage)
│
├── STEP 3: Generate Questions (Priority Order)
│   ├── P0: Blocking decisions (cannot proceed without answer)
│   ├── P1: High-leverage (affects >30% of implementation)
│   ├── P2: Medium-leverage (affects specific features)
│   └── P3: Nice-to-have (edge cases, optimization)
│
└── STEP 4: Format Each Question
    ├── What: Clear question
    ├── Why: Impact on implementation
    ├── Options: Trade-offs (not just A vs B)
    └── Default: What happens if user doesn't answer
```

## 🔄 Iterative Questioning

### First Pass (3-5 Questions)
Focus on **blocking decisions**. Don't proceed without answers.

### Second Pass (After Initial Implementation)
As patterns emerge, ask:
- "This feature implies [X]. Should we handle [edge case] now or defer?"
- "We're using [Pattern A]. Should [Feature B] follow the same pattern?"

### Third Pass (Optimization)
When functionality works:
- "Performance bottleneck at [X]. Optimize now or acceptable for now?"
- "Refactor [Y] for maintainability or ship as-is?"

## 🔴 CRITICAL DECISIONS (Cannot Proceed Without Answers)

### 1. **Photo Storage Strategy**

**Question:** Where will user photos be stored and served?

**Why This Matters:**
- Affects: Monthly hosting costs, page load speed, CDN complexity
- High-volume social apps: 1000 users × 10 photos × 2MB = 20GB storage

**Options:**
| Option | Cost model | Speed | Complexity | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| **Cloudinary** | Per-tier subscription | Fast (CDN) | Low | MVP, rapid launch |
| **AWS S3 + CloudFront** | Pay per GB stored/served | Fast (CDN) | Medium | Production, cost-optimized |
| **Supabase Storage** | Free tier + usage | Medium | Low | Small scale, simple |
| **Local Storage** | Server cost | Slow | Low | Development only |

**If Not Specified:** Cloudinary (balanced for MVP)

---

### 2. **Feed Algorithm Choice**

**Question:** How should the main feed work?

**Why This Matters:**
- Affects: Database query complexity, caching strategy, development time
- Algorithmic feeds require ML infrastructure, ranking signals

**Options:**
| Option | Complexity | Database Impact | Best For |
|--------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Chronological** | Low | Simple query | Early stage, transparency |
| **Follow-Only** | Medium | JOIN with pagination | Most social apps |
| **Algorithmic** | High | Pre-computed feed tables | Instagram competitor |

**If Not Specified:** Follow-Only (balanced for social app)

---

### 3. **Authentication Approach**

**Question:** How do users sign up and login?

**Why This Matters:**
- Affects: Development effort, security posture, UX friction

**Options:**
| Option | Effort | Security | UX | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|-----|----------|
| **Email/Password** | Higher | High (if 2FA) | Medium | Full control needed |
| **Social Only** | Low | Provider-dependent | Smooth | B2C, rapid launch |
| **Magic Link** | Medium | Medium | Very smooth | Security-focused |
| **Clerk/Auth0** | Lowest | High | Smooth | Fastest to market |

**If Not Specified:** Clerk (fastest for MVP)

---

## 🟡 HIGH-LEVERAGE (Affects Architecture)

### 4. **Real-time Notifications**

**Question:** Do users need instant notifications for likes/comments?

**Why This Matters:**
- WebSocket adds infrastructure complexity (Redis pub/sub for scaling)
- Polling is simpler but higher latency

**Options:**
| Option | Complexity | Scale Cost | Best For |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| **WebSocket + Redis** | High | $10+/mo | >1000 concurrent users |
| **Polling (30s)** | Low | DB queries | <1000 users |
| **No Real-time** | None | None | MVP, validate first |

**If Not Specified:** Polling for MVP (defer WebSocket until validated)

---

## 🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE (Defer to v2)

### 5. **Video/Reels Support**
- Major complexity (video processing, streaming infrastructure)
- Recommendation: Launch with photos only, add video after validation

### 6. **Direct Messaging**
- Separate subsystem (chat infrastructure different from feed)
- Recommendation: Use Pusher/Stream for real-time or defer entirely

---

## 📋 Summary

| Decision | Recommendation | If Changed |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Storage | Cloudinary | +3 hrs setup |
| Feed | Follow-only | +2 hrs query optimization |
| Auth | Clerk | -3 hrs dev time |
| Real-time | Polling | +5 hrs WebSocket setup |
| Video | Defer to v2 | N/A |
| DM | Defer to v2 | N/A |

**Scope:** MVP covers the must-haves above; Video and DM deferred to v2.
```

## 🎯 Principles Recap

1. **Every question = Architectural decision** → Not data gathering
2. **Show trade-offs** → User understands consequences
3. **Prioritize blocking decisions** → Cannot proceed without
4. **Provide defaults** → If user doesn't answer, we proceed anyway
5. **Domain-aware** → Ecommerce questions ≠ Auth questions ≠ Real-time questions
6. **Iterative** → More questions as patterns emerge during implementation
